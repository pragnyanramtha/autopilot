12. Macro Execution (1 action)

### 13.2 Create Protocol Examples ✅

**Files Created:**
- `examples/protocols/simple_search.json`
- `examples/protocols/twitter_post.json`
- `examples/protocols/visual_verification_workflow.json`
- `examples/protocols/complex_macro_workflow.json`
- `examples/protocols/file_management_workflow.json`
- `examples/protocols/multi_window_workflow.json`
- `examples/protocols/README.md`
- `examples/protocols/EXAMPLES_SUMMARY.md`
- `examples/protocols/validate_examples.py`

**Content:**
Each example demonstrates different protocol features:
1. **Simple Search**: Basic macros and variable substitution
2. **Twitter Post**: Visual verification and content generation
3. **Visual Verification**: Multiple verification checkpoints
4. **Complex Macro**: Nested macros and multi-window management
5. **File Management**: File system operations and folder creation
6. **Multi-Window**: Window switching and clipboard operations

### 13.3 Create System Documentation ✅

**File Created:** `docs/PROTOCOL_SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md` (1277 lines)

**Content:**

#### 1. Protocol Schema
- Complete schema structure with all fields
- Field descriptions for version, metadata, macros, actions
- Variable substitution syntax and usage
- 10 schema validation rules
- Examples of valid and invalid protocols

#### 2. Troubleshooting Guide
- 10 common issues with solutions:
  1. Protocol validation errors
  2. Macro not found
  3. Circular macro dependencies
  4. Missing variable substitution
  5. Action execution failures
  6. Visual verification timeout
  7. Timing issues
  8. Mouse movement issues
  9. Keyboard shortcut not working
  10. Long text typing slow
- Debugging tips and best practices
- Example fixes for each issue

#### 3. Visual Verification Usage
- When to use visual verification
- Basic verification syntax
- Adaptive mouse movement with verified coordinates
- Confidence threshold guidelines (0.6-0.95)
- Writing good verification descriptions
- Multi-step verification workflows
- Fallback behavior (primary/backup models)
- 7 best practices for visual verification

#### 4. Macro Creation and Usage
- Basic macro definition and usage
- Macros with single and multiple variables
- Nested macros (macros calling other macros)
- 7 macro best practices
- Common macro patterns (new_tab, focus_address_bar, save_file, etc.)
- Variable naming conventions
- Testing strategies

#### 5. Performance Optimization Tips
- 10 optimization techniques:
  1. Minimize wait times (with timing guidelines)
  2. Use clipboard for long text (>500 chars)
  3. Reduce visual verification calls
  4. Use shortcuts instead of mouse
  5. Batch similar actions
  6. Optimize mouse movement speed
  7. Use macros to reduce duplication
  8. Disable smooth mouse when not needed
  9. Parallel execution considerations
  10. Profile and measure performance
- Performance checklist
- Optimization workflow

# Communication Module Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a simple file-based communication layer for the AI Automation Assistant that enables bidirectional message passing between the AI Brain and Automation Engine components.

## Implementation Details

### Files Created
1. **shared/communication.py** - Main communication module
2. **test_communication.py** - Comprehensive test suite
3. **example_communication_flow.py** - Complete workflow demonstration

### Key Components

#### MessageBroker Class
The core class that handles all communication operations:

- **send_workflow(workflow)** - Serializes and sends workflows to automation engine
- **receive_workflow(timeout)** - Polls for and receives workflows from AI brain
- **send_status(result)** - Sends execution status back to AI brain
- **receive_status(workflow_id, timeout)** - Receives status for specific workflow
- **clear_messages()** - Cleans up all pending messages

### Features Implemented

✓ **Structured Serialization** (Requirement 8.1)
- Workflows serialized to JSON with complete metadata
- Includes timestamp, workflow ID, and all step details
- Maintains data integrity through structured format

✓ **Workflow Parsing & Validation** (Requirement 8.2)
- Deserializes JSON back to Workflow objects
- Validates data structure during deserialization
- Raises CommunicationError for invalid data

✓ **Bidirectional Communication** (Requirement 8.3)
- Workflows flow from AI Brain → Automation Engine
- Status reports flow from Automation Engine → AI Brain
- File-based message queue ensures reliable delivery

✓ **Status Reporting** (Requirement 8.6)
- ExecutionResult objects sent back after workflow completion
- Includes status, steps completed, errors, and duration
- AI Brain can poll for status with configurable timeout

### Message Format

**Workflow Message:**
```json
{
  "type": "workflow",
  "id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601",
  "payload": {
    "steps": [...],
    "metadata": {...},
    "created_at": "ISO8601"
  }
}
```

**Status Message:**
```json
{
  "type": "status",
  "workflow_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601",
  "payload": {
    "status": "success|failed|interrupted",
    "steps_completed": 3,
    "error": null,
    "duration_ms": 1500
  }
}
```

### File Structure
Messages are stored in:
- `shared/messages/workflows/` - Pending workflows
- `shared/messages/status/` - Execution status reports

Files are automatically cleaned up after being read.

## Testing Results

All tests passed successfully:

✓ Workflow communication (send/receive)
✓ Status communication (send/receive)
✓ Error status handling
✓ Timeout behavior
✓ Data integrity verification
✓ Complete bidirectional flow

## Usage Example

```python
from shared.communication import MessageBroker
from shared.data_models import Workflow, WorkflowStep, ExecutionResult

# AI Brain sends workflow
broker = MessageBroker()
workflow = Workflow(id="123", steps=[...])
broker.send_workflow(workflow)

# Automation Engine receives and executes
workflow = broker.receive_workflow(timeout=5.0)
# ... execute workflow ...
result = ExecutionResult(workflow_id="123", status="success", ...)
broker.send_status(result)

# AI Brain receives status
status = broker.receive_status("123", timeout=5.0)
```

## Next Steps

This communication layer is ready to be integrated with:
- Task 6: AI Brain main application
- Task 7: Automation Engine main application

The simple file-based approach provides reliable message passing without requiring external dependencies like ZeroMQ, making it easy to set up and use.

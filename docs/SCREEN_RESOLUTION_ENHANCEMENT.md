# Screen Resolution Enhancement for Visual Verification

## Issue

The visual verification system was asking the AI to provide pixel coordinates without telling it the actual screen resolution. This could lead to:
- Incorrect coordinate calculations
- AI guessing based on image analysis alone
- Coordinates that don't match the actual screen dimensions
- Inconsistent results across different screen resolutions

## Solution

Updated `shared/visual_verifier.py` to include screen resolution in the verification prompt.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Get Screen Resolution
```python
# Get screen resolution
try:
    screen_width, screen_height = self.screen_capture.get_screen_size()
except:
    # Default to common resolution if unable to detect
    screen_width, screen_height = 1920, 1080
```

#### 2. Include in Prompt Header
```
**Screen Resolution:** {screen_width}x{screen_height} pixels
```

#### 3. Clarify Coordinate Requirements
```
- The screen resolution is {screen_width}x{screen_height}, so x must be 0-{screen_width} and y must be 0-{screen_height}
- Provide actual pixel coordinates, not percentages or ratios
```

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Coordinates**: AI knows the exact screen dimensions
2. **Better Validation**: AI can validate coordinates are within bounds
3. **Consistent Results**: Works correctly across different screen resolutions
4. **Clearer Instructions**: AI understands it should provide pixels, not percentages
5. **Fallback Safety**: Defaults to 1920x1080 if detection fails

## How It Works

### Before
```
Prompt: "Provide coordinates in pixels from top-left corner (x, y)"
AI: *guesses based on image* → might return wrong coordinates
```

### After
```
Prompt: "Screen Resolution: 1920x1080 pixels
         Provide coordinates in pixels (x must be 0-1920, y must be 0-1080)"
AI: *knows exact dimensions* → returns accurate coordinates
```

## Example

For a 1920x1080 screen with a button at the center:

**Before (without resolution):**
- AI might guess: (960, 540) ✓ correct by luck
- Or might return: (50%, 50%) ✗ wrong format
- Or might scale incorrectly: (480, 270) ✗ wrong scale

**After (with resolution):**
- AI knows: Screen is 1920x1080
- AI calculates: Center is at (960, 540)
- AI returns: {"x": 960, "y": 540} ✓ correct

## Comparison with Vision Navigator

The `vision_navigator.py` already included screen resolution in its prompts:
```python
Screen size: {width}x{height} pixels
Coordinates must be within screen bounds (0-{width}, 0-{height})
```

Now `visual_verifier.py` has the same capability, ensuring consistency across both visual systems.

## Testing

The enhancement is backward compatible and requires no changes to existing code. The visual verifier will automatically:
1. Detect screen resolution using `screen_capture.get_screen_size()`
2. Include it in the prompt
3. Fall back to 1920x1080 if detection fails

- `shared/visual_verifier.py` - Updated with screen resolution
- `automation_engine/screen_capture.py` - Provides `get_screen_size()` method
- `ai_brain/vision_navigator.py` - Already includes screen resolution (reference)

## Impact

This enhancement improves:
- ✅ Coordinate accuracy
- ✅ Cross-resolution compatibility
- ✅ AI understanding of screen dimensions
- ✅ Consistency with vision_navigator
- ✅ Error prevention (out-of-bounds coordinates)

No breaking changes - fully backward compatible.

# Communication Fix

## Issues Fixed

### Issue #1: Results Not Received by AI Brain
The automation engine was successfully executing protocols, but the AI Brain showed:
```
No result received (timeout or automation engine not running)
```

### Issue #2: GEMINI_API_KEY Not Found in Automation Engine
The automation engine showed:
```
⚠ GEMINI_API_KEY not found - vision features disabled
```

Even though the .env file existed with the API key.

## Root Causes

### Cause #1: Protocol ID Mismatch
The AI Brain and automation engine were using different fields for the protocol ID:
- **AI Brain**: Looking for `protocol.metadata.id` (which was "unknown")
- **Automation Engine**: Using `protocol.metadata.description` as the protocol_id

When the automation engine sent back the result with `protocol_id = description`, the AI Brain couldn't find it because it was looking for a result with `protocol_id = "unknown"`.

### Cause #2: Missing .env Loading
The automation engine wasn't loading the `.env` file, so environment variables like `GEMINI_API_KEY` weren't available.

## Solutions

### Solution #1: Use Consistent Protocol ID
Updated `ai_brain/main.py` to use `description` as the protocol_id (matching what the executor uses):

**Before:**
```python
protocol_id = protocol.get('metadata', {}).get('id', 'unknown')
```

**After:**
```python
# Use description as protocol_id (same as executor uses)
protocol_id = protocol.get('metadata', {}).get('description', 'unknown')
```

This change was made in two places:
1. `_handle_simple_protocol` method
2. `_handle_complex_protocol` method

### Solution #2: Load .env File
Updated `automation_engine/main.py` to load environment variables:

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()
```

## How Communication Works

1. **AI Brain generates protocol**:
   - Protocol has metadata with `description` field
   - Example: `"description": "Search for 'pragnyan ramtha' in the default browser."`

2. **AI Brain sends protocol**:
   - Extracts `protocol_id` from `metadata.description`
   - Sends protocol to automation engine via file
   - Waits for result with that `protocol_id`

3. **Automation engine executes**:
   - Receives protocol
   - Executes actions
   - Creates `ExecutionResult` with `protocol_id = protocol.metadata.description`

4. **Automation engine sends result**:
   - Sends result back with the `protocol_id`
   - Creates status file: `{protocol_id}_status.json`

5. **AI Brain receives result**:
   - Looks for status file matching the `protocol_id`
   - Displays execution result to user

## What This Fixes
- ✅ AI Brain now receives execution results
- ✅ Shows success/failure status
- ✅ Displays actions completed, duration, and any errors
- ✅ Visual verifier can be initialized (with GEMINI_API_KEY loaded)
- ✅ Complete feedback loop between AI Brain and automation engine

## Testing
1. Restart both components to pick up changes
2. Send a command from AI Brain
3. You should now see:
   ```
   ✓ Protocol sent (ID: Search for 'pragnyan ramtha' in the default browser.)
   
   Execution SUCCESS
     Steps completed: 4
     Duration: 7226ms
   ```

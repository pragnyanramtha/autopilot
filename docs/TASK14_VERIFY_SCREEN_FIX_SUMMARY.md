# Task 14: Verify Screen Variable Substitution Fix

## Issue Summary

The automation engine was failing when executing protocols with this error:

```
ERROR: Action 3 (mouse_move) failed: Missing required variables in context: verified_x. 
Available variables: suggested_actions, last_verification_safe, last_verification_confidence, last_verification_analysis. 
Hint: Variables like 'verified_x' and 'verified_y' come from 'verify_screen' action results.
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problematic Pattern

The AI was generating protocols like this:

```json
{
  "actions": [
    {"action": "verify_screen", "params": {"context": "Looking for compose area", "expected": "Compose area visible"}},
    {"action": "mouse_move", "params": {"x": "{{verified_x}}", "y": "{{verified_y}}"}},
    {"action": "mouse_click", "params": {"button": "left"}}
  ]
}
```

### Why It Failed

1. **When `verify_screen` succeeds** (finds the target):
   - Sets: `verified_x`, `verified_y`, `last_verification_safe` (True), etc.
   - ‚úÖ `mouse_move` can use `{{verified_x}}` and `{{verified_y}}`

2. **When `verify_screen` fails** (NOT SAFE - page loading, element not visible, window blocking):
   - Sets: `last_verification_safe` (False), `last_verification_confidence`, `last_verification_analysis`, `suggested_actions`
   - Does NOT set: `verified_x`, `verified_y`
   - ‚ùå `mouse_move` tries to use `{{verified_x}}` ‚Üí ERROR

### The Core Problem

The protocol pattern assumed `verify_screen` would ALWAYS succeed and provide coordinates. In reality, it often fails during:
- Page loading
- UI state transitions
- Window overlays
- Element not yet rendered

## Solution Implemented

### Changed Protocol Generation Prompts

Updated `ai_brain/gemini_client.py` to instruct the AI to use `visual_navigate` instead of the `verify_screen` + `mouse_move` + `mouse_click` pattern.

### Files Modified

1. **ai_brain/gemini_client.py**
   - Updated `_build_protocol_prompt_template()` method
   - Updated `_build_simpler_protocol_prompt()` method
   - Changed 3 examples to use `visual_navigate`
   - Updated rule #3 about visual verification
   - Modified social media posting instructions

### The New Pattern

```json
{
  "actions": [
    {"action": "visual_navigate", "params": {"target_description": "the blue Login button", "action_type": "click"}}
  ]
}
```

### Why This Works

The `visual_navigate` action:
1. **Handles verification internally** - No exposed variables
2. **Automatic retry logic** - Keeps trying if element not found
3. **Graceful failure handling** - Proper error messages
4. **Atomic operation** - Find + click in one step
5. **No variable substitution issues** - Everything is internal

## Changes in Detail

### 1. Updated Example 3 (Twitter Posting)

**Before:**
```json
{"action": "verify_screen", ...},
{"action": "mouse_move", "params": {"x": "{{verified_x}}", "y": "{{verified_y}}"}},
{"action": "mouse_click", ...},
{"action": "type", ...},
{"action": "verify_screen", ...},
{"action": "mouse_move", "params": {"x": "{{verified_x}}", "y": "{{verified_y}}"}},
{"action": "mouse_click", ...}
```

**After:**
```json
{"action": "visual_navigate", "params": {"target_description": "the 'What's happening?' post compose input field", "action_type": "click"}},
{"action": "type", ...},
{"action": "visual_navigate", "params": {"target_description": "the blue 'Post' button to publish the tweet", "action_type": "click"}}
```

### 2. Updated Example 4 (Visual Navigation)

**Before:** "Visual Verification Usage" - showed verify_screen + mouse_move pattern

**After:** "Visual Navigation Usage" - shows single visual_navigate action

### 3. Updated Rule #3

**Before:**
```
Use "verify_screen" when you're uncertain about UI state or element location
After verification, use {{verified_x}} and {{verified_y}} for coordinates
```

**After:**
```
Use "visual_navigate" to find and click UI elements (handles verification + click automatically)
Use "verify_screen" ONLY for checking state without clicking
NEVER use verify_screen followed by mouse_move - use visual_navigate instead
```

### 4. Updated Simpler Prompt Template

Changed the example format from 11 actions (with verify_screen + mouse_move) to 7 actions (with visual_navigate).

### 5. Updated Social Media Instructions

**Before:**
```
Use verify_screen to find compose area
Click compose area using verified coordinates
Use verify_screen to find Post button
Click Post button using verified coordinates
```

**After:**
```
Use visual_navigate to find and click compose area
Use visual_navigate to find and click Post button
IMPORTANT: Use visual_navigate instead of verify_screen + mouse_move + mouse_click
```

## Action Usage Guidelines

### Use `visual_navigate` When:
- You need to find AND interact with a UI element
- Clicking buttons, links, input fields
- Any action that requires both finding and clicking
- Example: "Click the Post button", "Click the login form"

### Use `verify_screen` When:
- You only need to CHECK if something is visible
- Validation/confirmation without interaction
- State verification
- Example: "Verify page loaded", "Check if login succeeded"
- **NEVER** follow with `mouse_move` using `{{verified_x}}` and `{{verified_y}}`

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite:

### Test Files
1. **tests/test_verify_screen_fix.py** - Validates that new protocols use correct pattern
2. **docs/VERIFY_SCREEN_FIX.md** - Detailed explanation
3. **docs/VERIFY_SCREEN_FIX_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Quick reference guide

### Running Tests
```bash
python tests/test_verify_screen_fix.py
```

The test:
- Generates a protocol for "Post a CSS joke on X"
- Checks for problematic verify_screen + mouse_move pattern
- Verifies visual_navigate is used instead
- Prints full protocol for inspection

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before Fix
```
[1/9] Executing: open_url
[2/9] Executing: verify_screen
  ‚úó NOT SAFE (confidence: 1.00)
[3/9] Executing: mouse_move
  ERROR: Missing required variables in context: verified_x
Protocol Execution Complete: failed (2/9 actions)
```

### After Fix
```
[1/7] Executing: open_app
[2/7] Executing: shortcut
[3/7] Executing: type
[4/7] Executing: press_key
[5/7] Executing: visual_navigate
  üîç Looking for: the 'What's happening?' post compose input field
  ‚úì Found and clicked successfully
[6/7] Executing: type
[7/7] Executing: visual_navigate
  üîç Looking for: the blue 'Post' button
  ‚úì Found and clicked successfully
Protocol Execution Complete: success (7/7 actions)
```

## Benefits

1. **No More Variable Errors** - visual_navigate handles everything internally
2. **Better Reliability** - Automatic retry when elements aren't immediately visible
3. **Simpler Protocols** - Fewer actions needed (7 vs 12)
4. **Graceful Failures** - Proper error messages instead of variable substitution errors
5. **Handles Loading States** - Waits for elements to appear
6. **More Maintainable** - Single action instead of 3-action sequence

## Impact

This fix affects:
- ‚úÖ All future protocol generation
- ‚úÖ Twitter/X posting workflows
- ‚úÖ Any UI interaction requiring element finding
- ‚úÖ Social media automation
- ‚úÖ Web form interactions

## Verification

To verify the fix is working:

1. **Clear AI cache** (if needed):
   ```python
   # The AI caches protocol responses, so you may need to restart
   # or use a slightly different command to bypass cache
   ```

2. **Test with a posting command**:
   ```
   "Post a CSS joke on X"
   "Tweet about Python"
   "Make a post about AI"
   ```

3. **Check the generated protocol**:
   - Should use `visual_navigate` for clicking
   - Should NOT have `verify_screen` followed by `mouse_move`
   - Should have fewer total actions

4. **Run the protocol**:
   - Should complete successfully
   - Should handle page loading gracefully
   - Should not fail with variable substitution errors

## Additional Enhancement: Screen Resolution

While fixing the main issue, we also enhanced the visual verification system to include screen resolution in the AI prompts.

### The Enhancement

Updated `shared/visual_verifier.py` to:
1. Get the actual screen resolution using `screen_capture.get_screen_size()`
2. Include it in the verification prompt: `**Screen Resolution:** 1920x1080 pixels`
3. Clarify coordinate requirements: `x must be 0-1920, y must be 0-1080`
4. Fall back to 1920x1080 if detection fails

### Why This Matters

**Before:** AI had to guess screen dimensions from the image alone
**After:** AI knows exact screen dimensions and can provide accurate pixel coordinates

This ensures:
- ‚úÖ Accurate coordinate calculations
- ‚úÖ Works correctly across different screen resolutions
- ‚úÖ AI validates coordinates are within bounds
- ‚úÖ Consistent with `vision_navigator` which already had this feature

See `docs/SCREEN_RESOLUTION_ENHANCEMENT.md` for details.

## Conclusion

This fix addresses a fundamental issue in how the AI was generating protocols for UI interactions. By switching from the fragile `verify_screen` + `mouse_move` pattern to the robust `visual_navigate` action, we've made the automation:

- More reliable
- Easier to understand
- Better at handling real-world UI states
- Less prone to timing issues
- More maintainable

The fix is implemented entirely in the prompt templates, so no code changes were needed in the execution engine. All existing functionality remains intact, and the system will now generate better protocols automatically.

Additionally, the screen resolution enhancement ensures that when visual verification is used, the AI has accurate information about screen dimensions for precise coordinate calculations.

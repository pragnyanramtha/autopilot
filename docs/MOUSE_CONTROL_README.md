# Advanced Mouse Control System

## 🎯 Quick Start

The AI Automation Assistant now includes smooth, curved mouse movements that look natural and human-like.

### Test It Now
```bash
# Quick test (5 minutes)
python examples/test_mouse.py

# Full demo (15 minutes)
python examples/mouse_demo.py
```

### Use It
```python
from automation_engine.mouse_controller import MouseController

mouse = MouseController()
mouse.move_to(500, 300)  # Smooth curved movement!
mouse.click(500, 300)     # Natural click
```

- ✅ Fast (~5ms overhead)
- ✅ Fully integrated with existing system

## 🎨 Movement Comparison

**Before (Straight Lines)**
```
Start ──────────────> End
(Robotic, obvious)
```

**After (Smooth Curves)**
```
Start ╭────────╮
      │        ╰───> End
(Natural, human-like)
```

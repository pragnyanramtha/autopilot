# Automation Engine Fix

## Issue
The automation engine was receiving protocols but failing to execute them with the error:
```
Registered actions: 0
ERROR: Action 1 (open_app) failed: Unknown action: open_app
```

## Root Cause
The `AutomationEngineApp` was creating an `ActionRegistry` but never registering any action handlers with it. This meant the registry was empty, so when the protocol executor tried to execute actions like `open_app`, `type`, `click`, etc., they were all unknown.

## Solution
Updated `automation_engine/main.py` to register all action handlers during initialization:

```python
def __init__(self, config_path: str = "config.json", dry_run: bool = False):
    """Initialize the Automation Engine application."""
    self.config = self._load_config(config_path)
    self.dry_run = dry_run
    
    # Initialize components
    self.action_registry = ActionRegistry()
    
    # Register all action handlers - THIS WAS MISSING!
    from shared.action_handlers import ActionHandlers
    action_handlers = ActionHandlers(self.action_registry)
    action_handlers.register_all()
    
    self.executor = ProtocolExecutor(
        action_registry=self.action_registry,
        dry_run=dry_run
    )
    # ... rest of initialization
```

## What This Fixes
- ✅ Automation engine now has all actions registered (keyboard, mouse, window, browser, etc.)
- ✅ Protocols can be executed successfully
- ✅ Actions like `open_app`, `type`, `click`, `shortcut`, etc. are now recognized
- ✅ The "Registered actions: 0" message will now show the actual count (50+ actions)

## Testing
1. Start the automation engine:
   ```bash
   scripts\start_automation_engine.bat
   ```

2. You should now see:
   ```
   Registered actions: 50+  (instead of 0)
   ```

3. Start the AI Brain and send a command:
   ```bash
   start_ai.bat
   ```
   
4. Try: "search for someone named pragnyan ramtha"

5. The automation engine should now successfully execute all 4 actions:
   - ✅ open_app (Chrome)
   - ✅ shortcut (Ctrl+L)
   - ✅ type (pragnyan ramtha)
   - ✅ press_key (Enter)

## Files Modified
- `automation_engine/main.py` - Added action handler registration

## Related Fixes
This fix complements the earlier protocol generator fixes:
- Protocol Generator Fix #1: Added action_library parameter
- Protocol Generator Fix #2: Fixed protocol validation

Together, these fixes make the complete AI automation system work end-to-end!

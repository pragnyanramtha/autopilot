# Visual Navigation Fix - Quick Reference

## What Was Fixed

**Problem**: Visual navigation timed out after 60 seconds when triggered from protocols

**Root Cause**: AI Brain was blocking on user input, couldn't process incoming visual navigation requests

**Solution**: Made AI Brain main loop non-blocking with background thread for user input

## Key Changes

### 1. Non-Blocking Main Loop
```python
# Now polls for both user input AND visual navigation requests
while self.running:
    # Check for visual navigation requests (100ms timeout)
    visual_request = self.message_broker.receive_visual_navigation_request(timeout=0.1)
    if visual_request:
        self._handle_incoming_visual_navigation_request(visual_request)
    
    # Check for user input (non-blocking)
    command = input_queue.get(timeout=0.1)
```

### 2. New Method
```python
def _handle_incoming_visual_navigation_request(self, request: dict):
    """Handle visual navigation requests from automation engine"""
    # Request screenshot
    # Execute workflow
    # Send result back
```

### 3. Refactored Workflow
```python
def _execute_visual_navigation_workflow(...):
    """Common workflow logic for both user and protocol requests"""
    # Used by both user commands and protocol execution
```

## How to Test

### Test Protocol Execution
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start automation engine
python automation_engine/main.py

# Terminal 2: Start AI Brain
python ai_brain/main.py

# Terminal 3: Send protocol with visual_navigate
python -c "
from shared.communication import MessageBroker
broker = MessageBroker()
broker.send_protocol({
    'name': 'Test',
    'actions': [{
        'action': 'visual_navigate',
        'params': {'task': 'Click the Chrome icon'}
    }]
})
"
```

### Expected Result
- âœ… AI Brain receives request immediately
- âœ… Visual navigation executes
- âœ… Result sent back within timeout
- âœ… No "timed out after 60s" error

## Quick Verification

Run this to verify the fix is working:

```python
# In AI Brain console, you should see:
# "ðŸ“¸ Incoming visual navigation request from automation engine"
# "Task: Click the Chrome icon"
# "â†’ Requesting screenshot from automation engine..."
# "âœ“ Screenshot received"
# "â†’ Iteration 1: Analyzing screen..."
# etc.
```

## Files Modified

- `ai_brain/main.py` - Main loop, new methods, imports

## Status

âœ… **FIXED** - Visual navigation now works from both:
- User commands (as before)
- Protocol execution (now working!)

## Performance

- Polling interval: 100ms (0.1 seconds)
- No noticeable latency
- User input still responsive
- Visual navigation requests handled immediately

## Backward Compatibility

âœ… **100% Compatible** - No breaking changes

**Quick Start**: Just restart AI Brain with the updated code. No config changes needed!

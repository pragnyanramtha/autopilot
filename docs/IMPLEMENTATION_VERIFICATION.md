# Task 4 Implementation Verification

## Task: Implement automation executor with safety controls

### Implementation Summary

Created `automation_engine/executor.py` with the `AutomationExecutor` class that provides:
- Sequential workflow execution
- Pause/resume/stop controls
- Emergency stop functionality
- Safety checks for dangerous actions
- Dry-run mode for testing
- Real-time execution feedback

### Requirements Coverage

#### Requirement 4.4: Respect timing delays between actions ✓
**Implementation:**
- Each `WorkflowStep` has a `delay_ms` parameter
- Executor applies delays after each step execution: `time.sleep(step.delay_ms / 1000.0)`
- Separate `wait` step type for explicit delays

**Code Reference:** Lines 115-120 in `executor.py`

#### Requirement 4.5: Report errors and halt execution on failure ✓
**Implementation:**
- Try-catch blocks around step execution
- Errors captured in `ExecutionResult.error` field
- Execution halts immediately on step failure
- Detailed error messages with step number

**Code Reference:** Lines 100-145 in `executor.py`

#### Requirement 4.6: Provide real-time feedback on progress ✓
**Implementation:**
- `get_execution_status()` method returns current state
- Console output for each step execution
- Status includes: running state, paused state, current step, total steps
- Progress tracking with step counter

**Code Reference:** Lines 380-395 in `executor.py`

#### Requirement 7.1: Emergency stop mechanism ✓
**Implementation:**
- `stop_execution()` method sets stop signal
- Checked before each step execution
- `_check_user_interrupt()` detects significant mouse movement
- Thread-safe state management with locks

**Code Reference:** Lines 360-378, 330-345 in `executor.py`

#### Requirement 7.2: Require confirmation for dangerous actions ✓
**Implementation:**
- `DANGEROUS_ACTIONS` set with keywords: delete, remove, format, shutdown, etc.
- `_is_dangerous_action()` method checks text for dangerous patterns
- Raises `ValueError` when dangerous action detected (non-dry-run mode)
- Logs warning in dry-run mode

**Code Reference:** Lines 28-32, 310-328 in `executor.py`

#### Requirement 7.3: Implement dry-run mode ✓
**Implementation:**
- Constructor accepts `dry_run` parameter
- All actions logged but not executed when `dry_run=True`
- Each step execution method checks dry-run flag
- Test output shows "[DRY RUN]" prefix

**Code Reference:** Lines 35-36, 240-305 in `executor.py`

### Key Features Implemented

1. **AutomationExecutor Class**
   - Integrates `InputController` and `ScreenCapture`
   - Thread-safe execution state management
   - Support for multiple step types: mouse_move, click, type, press_key, hotkey, wait, capture

2. **Safety Controls**
   - Emergency stop via `stop_execution()`
   - Pause/resume functionality
   - Mouse movement detection for user interrupts
   - Dangerous action validation
   - Configurable mouse movement threshold (50 pixels)

3. **Workflow Execution**
   - Sequential step execution
   - Error handling and reporting
   - Execution timing and duration tracking
   - Status reporting with `ExecutionResult`

4. **Step Types Supported**
   - `mouse_move`: Move mouse to coordinates
   - `click`: Perform mouse clicks (left/right/double)
   - `type`: Type text with configurable interval
   - `press_key`: Press single keys
   - `hotkey`: Press key combinations
   - `wait`: Explicit delays
   - `capture`: Screen capture (full or region)

### Test Results

All tests passed successfully:
- ✓ Basic workflow execution (5 steps)
- ✓ Dangerous action detection
- ✓ Control functions (pause/resume/stop)
- ✓ Hotkey execution

**Test Output:**

### Files Created

1. `automation_engine/executor.py` - Main executor implementation (395 lines)
2. `test_executor.py` - Comprehensive test suite
3. `setup_venv.bat` - Virtual environment setup script
4. `IMPLEMENTATION_VERIFICATION.md` - This verification document

### Dependencies Used

- `threading` - Thread-safe state management
- `time` - Delay execution and timing
- `datetime` - Timestamp tracking
- `shared.data_models` - Workflow, WorkflowStep, ExecutionResult
- `automation_engine.input_controller` - Mouse/keyboard control
- `automation_engine.screen_capture` - Screen capture functionality

### Next Steps

The automation executor is now ready for integration with:
- Task 5: File-based communication layer
- Task 6: AI Brain main application
- Task 7: Automation Engine main application

The executor can be used immediately in dry-run mode for testing workflows without performing actual actions.

```

## 📜 Scripts in This Folder

### Alternative Launchers
- **`start_ai_brain.bat`** - Start AI Brain only
- **`start_automation_engine.bat`** - Start Automation Engine only
- **`start_both.bat`** - Start both in separate windows
- **`quick_start.bat`** - Interactive menu launcher

### Utilities
- **`cli.py`** - Old CLI interface (deprecated, use `run.py` instead)

## 💡 When to Use These

### Use `start_ai_brain.bat` when:
- You only want to test command parsing
- You don't need automation execution
- You're developing AI Brain features

### Use `start_automation_engine.bat` when:
- You only want to test automation
- You're developing Automation Engine features
- You want to test in DRY-RUN mode

### Use `start_both.bat` when:
- You want separate windows for each component
- You're debugging communication between components
- You prefer the old multi-window setup

### Use `quick_start.bat` when:
- You want an interactive menu
- You want to check system status
- You want to run tests

---

## ⚠️ Note

These are alternative launchers. For normal use, just run:
```cmd
..\run.bat
```

This runs everything in one terminal with voice support!
